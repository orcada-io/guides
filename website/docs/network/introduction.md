# Introduction

What hardware do you need to host a Cardano Stake Pool?

The answer is, it depends. However, at a minimum we suggest:

- 1 @ Internet Gateway (a modem/router combo typically supplied by your ISP)
- 1 @ Interior Router
- 2 @ Switches
- 1 @ NAS device
- 1 @ ARM device (to host your Cardano **Public Relay** nodes)
- 1 @ ARM device (to host your Cardano **Core** node and **Private Relay** node)
- 1 @ ARM device (to host your Cardano **Cold** node)

For example:
- 1 @ Netcomm NF18 CloudMesh
- 1 @ tp-link ER605 Router
- 2 @ Netgear 308 Switch
- 1 @ Synology DS720+
- 2 @ HoneyComb LX2
- 1 @ Raspberry Pi 400
