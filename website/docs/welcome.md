# Welcome

Welcome to the <a href="https://orcada.io/" target="_blank">Orcada</a> Stake Pool Guides. 

These guides will help you to build and operate a Cardano Stake Pool, that:
- uses on premise infrastructure
- uses low cost hardware and software
- is energy efficient, and
- is resilient (scalable, highly available and secure)

These guides are based on our Stake Pool's infrastructure: internet gateway, interior router, switches, Network 
Attached Storage and ARM devices.

We have decided to make the guides publicly available so that other Stake Pool operators may benefit from the lessons 
we have learned.
